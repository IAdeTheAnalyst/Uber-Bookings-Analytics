# ðŸš— Uber Booking Analytics â€” MySQL Data Analysis

This project analyzes ride-booking operations using a transactional **bookings** dataset. By evaluating demand across time buckets, locations, vehicle types, and payment methods in **MySQL 8 (Workbench)**, it measures service speed, cancellations, ratings, and revenue efficiency to inform product & operations decisions.

## ðŸ§  Key Business Questions
1. What are the **top customer cancellation reasons** and how frequently does each occur?
2. How do **driver vs. customer cancellations** compare overall and over time?
3. What are the **average wait (VTAT)** and **completion (CTAT)** times by **vehicle type**?
4. Which **pickup locations** generate the highest **total booking value**?
5. How do **customer ratings** vary by **vehicle type**?
6. What is the **payment method mix** (share of rides)?
7. Which **vehicle type** yields the highest **revenue per kilometer**?
8. During which **time-of-day** do bookings peak, and how does this differ on **weekdays vs. weekends**?

- **SQL (MySQL 8+)** with **MySQL Workbench**
- **CTEs**, **Aggregations** (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `ROUND`)
